A roundup of PEcAn project activities and highlights from 2012.

<!--truncate-->

## Major Milestones

### PEcAn manuscript: Ecological Monographs (August 2012)

The first manuscript describing the initial components of the PEcAn project was accepted for publication:

LeBauer, D.S., D. Wang, K.T. Richter, C.C. Davidson, M.C. Dietze. Feedbacks between measurements and ecosystem models. Ecological Monographs _in press_

### PEcAn used to assess biofuel potential of hybrid Poplar (December 2012)

Wang, Dan, David LeBauer, and Michael C. Dietze. _In press._ Predicting yields of short-rotation hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) for the contiguous US through model-data synthesis. Ecological Applications. https://doi.org/10.1890/12-0854.1

In this paper the PEcAn workflow was used to calibrate the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2) for hybrid poplar using a combination of trait data and yield data. The validated model was used to make projections of potential poplar yields and optimal rotation periods across the continental US. The most promising regions for poplar production were identified as the Northeast, upper Midwest, and northern California.

## Software Releases

### PEcAn 1.2.6 Released (September 2012)

As of September 2012, PEcAn version 1.2.6 became the latest stable version. This version was released for the August 2012 summer course "Assimilating long-term data into ecosystem models" that taught methods advanced by the PalEON project. Available at: http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/download/index.php?project=PEcAn&sort=category

### PEcAn 1.1 Source Code Released (September 2012)

The PEcAn version 1.1 source code was released, including an R package with functions and R scripts used to run the PEcAn workflow. The PEcAn 1.1 Virtual Machine can reproduce all of the computational steps used in the manuscript "Facilitating feedbacks between field measurements and ecosystem models" (LeBauer et al in press).

## Conferences and Presentations

### PEcAn at FORECAST RCN 2012 (October 9-11, 2012)

Mike Dietze presented an invited talk on the PEcAn project at the FORECAST RCN meeting in Woods Hole, MA.

### PEcAn at ForestSAT 2012 (September 11-14, 2012)

Shawn Serbin presented a talk "From multiple datasets to predictive ecology: The PEcAn workflow and model-data assimilation" at the ForestSAT 2012 meeting in Corvallis, OR.

### PEcAn at ChEAS meeting 2012 (June 27-29, 2012)

Mike Dietze, Shawn Serbin, and Ankur Desai each presented a number of short talks on the PEcAn project at the annual investigator's meeting for the Chequamegon Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (ChEAS) held at the Kemp Biological Station, WI.

## Training and Education

### PEcAn at PalEON summer course 2012 (August 2012)

PEcAn was used for all aspects of the modeling and data assimilation activities in the week-long summer course "Assimilating Long-Term Data into Ecosystem Models" offered at the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center (UNDERC), Land O' Lakes, WI.

Mike Dietze presented 12 hours of lecture, tutorial, and hands-on demos using PEcAn, covering workflows for model calibration and analysis, parameter data assimilation at the Sylvania flux tower, and state-variable data assimilation of tree ring data.

PEcAn allowed students to go from coring trees Monday, mounting them Tuesday, and analyzing them Wednesday, to calibrating SIPNET Thursday using trait databases and flux tower data and assimilating the tree ring data on Friday.

## Student Achievements

### Carl Davidson defends Master's Thesis applying PEcAn to Alaskan Tundra (June 11, 2012)

Carl Davidson successfully defended his Master's thesis on ["The modeled effects of fire on carbon balance and vegetation abundance in Alaskan tundra"](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/34234).

Carl's thesis represents an incredible case-study in the application of the PEcAn system, using meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and variance decomposition to develop tundra PFTs, designing field campaigns based on model analysis, and assimilating field and flux data.

## Team Updates

### Toni Viskari joins PEcAn team (December 21, 2012)

Dr. Toni Viskari joined the PEcAn team as a postdoctoral fellow in the Dietze lab starting January 1, 2013. Toni worked on the NSF ABI project using the northern Wisconsin "ChEAS" project as a testbed for regional-scale multi-proxy data assimilation. Toni joined from the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the University of Helsinki.

## Upcoming Events

### PEcAn at NACP AIM4 (February 4-7, 2013)

The PEcAn team announced their planned participation at the 4th North American Carbon Program All-Investigators Meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mike Dietze, Ankur Desai, Trevor Keenan, and Quinn Thomas planned to chair a breakout session on "Harnessing the 'long tail' of ecosystem carbon cycle observations: Approaches and challenges in synthesizing and assimilating non-automated and experimental data".
