## Major Events

### PEcAn AGU Workshop (December 2017)

The PEcAn project held a two-part event at the 2017 AGU Fall meeting on Tuesday December 12th, 2017 from 4-7pm. The meeting included an open demonstration (4:00-5:30) followed by a focused science team collaborator meeting (5:30-7:00).

The event was held at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside, Third Floor - Parish Room.

The demonstration entailed a general overview of the project and breakout groups in which members of the PEcAn team led hands-on tutorials and took questions. The Science Team meeting focused on high-level development goals and user needs for the coming year.
