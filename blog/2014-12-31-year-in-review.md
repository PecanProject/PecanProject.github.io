Mike participated in several COST PROFOUND working groups and task groups. In particular, Mike Dietze and David Cameron (UK) co-organized Task Group 15 - Statistical problems in fitting models to heterogeneous data.

### Brown Dog Early User Workshop (July 22, 2014)

Kenton McHenry (Brown Dog PI, PEcAn co-PI) hosted the [Brown Dog Early User Workshop](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/BD/Workshop+I) from July 22-23, 2014 at NCSA in Urbana, Illinois.

Mike Dietze (PEcAn PI, Brown Dog co-PI) gave a presentation ([pdf](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/download/attachments/35324015/Dietze_BrownDog_2014.pdf), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU4YdRIWKHw)) on how Brown Dog will be used to access and harmonize vegetation and meteorological data, and how it will be incorporated into PEcAn.

Rob Kooper (NCSA Senior Programmer on both Brown Dog and PEcAn) presented on how Brown Dog will interact with other NSF computational resources. David LeBauer (PEcAn) presented a lightning talk on how Brown Dog might benefit BETYdb.

### PEcAn Summer Courses 2014 (August 2014)

Hands-on tutorials on using PEcAn were presented at the 2014 editions of the Niwot Ridge [Flux Course](http://www.fluxcourse.org/) and the [PalEON](http://paleonproject.org/) summer course _Assimilating Long Term Data into Ecosystem Models_.

### PEcAn Seminar for Harvard Forest REU program (July 2, 2014)

Mike Dietze was invited back to the Harvard Forest Summer REU program to present an evening seminar "The PEcAn Project: Carbon-Cycle Reanalysis Facilitated by Model-Data Ecoinformatics".

## Seminars and Invited Talks

### PEcAn seminar at Columbia University (October 7, 2014)

Mike Dietze gave a seminar "The PEcAn Project: A Community Platform for Synthesis & Forecasting of Ecosystems" in the Department of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental Biology (E3B) at Columbia University.

### PEcAn Workshop and Seminar at Kent State (September 26, 2014)

Mike Dietze gave a seminar in the Biology Department at Kent State titled "Terrestrial Ecosystems: Past, Present, & Future". While at Kent, Mike also ran a two-hour PEcAn workshop for departmental grad students and faculty.

### Dietze Tenure Talk (September 22, 2014)

Mike Dietze presented his tenure seminar "Terrestrial Ecosystems: Past, Present, & Future" to the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University. This talk focused on the PalEON and PEcAn projects and laid out the vision for PEcAn's future direction.

## Grants and Proposals

### PEcAn 2 Proposal Submitted (August 12, 2014)

Mike Dietze, Ankur Desai, and Kenton McHenry submitted the PEcAn renewal proposal ["Collaborative Research: ABI Development: The PEcAn Project: A Community Platform for Ecological Forecasting"](http://people.bu.edu/dietze/documents/PEcAn2.pdf) to the NSF program Advances in Biological Informatics (ABI).

The PEcAn 2 proposal focuses on three additional challenges:

1. The need for a scalable solution to improving models, both in the cyberinfrastructure and the involvement of the research community
2. The need to assess, track, and analyze model skill, structure, and uncertainty
3. The need to increase the accessibility of modeling tools

## Software Releases

### PEcAn 1.3.6 Released (July 28, 2014)

This version focused on more database updates, including improved site/data management and support for meteorology conversion from netCDF CF standard to SipNET's .clim driver files.

### PEcAn 1.3.5 Released (May 2014)

Major update switching to PostgreSQL, enabling distributed instances of BETYdb and maintaining local database changes. This enabled multiple installations to run BETYdb and exchange local changes across databases.
