# [GSoC - PEcAn Project Ideas](#background)

Ecosystem science has many components, so does PEcAn! Some of those components where you can contribute. Below is a list of potential ideas. Feel free to contact any of the mentors in slack, or feel free to ask questions in our #gsoc-2024 channel in slack.

## [Project Ideas](#ideas)

Following is a list of project ideas, use this list to contact the appropriate mentors on slack. Feel free to propose your own ideas as well, in this case contact @kooper in Slack so he can put you in contact with the best mentors.

#### [Global sensitivity analysis / uncertainty partitioning](#sa)

This project would extend PEcAn's existing uncertainty partitioning routines, which are primarily one-at-a-time and focused on model parameters, to also consider ensemble-based uncertainties in other model inputs (meteorology, soils, vegetation, phenology, etc). This project would employ Sobol' methods and some uncommitted code exists that manually prototyped how this would be done in PEcAn. The goal would be to refactor/reimplement this prototype into a reliable, automated system and apply it to some key test cases in both natural and managed ecosystems.


**Expected outcomes:**

A successful project would complete at subset of the following tasks:

* Reliable, automated Sensitivity analyss and uncertainty partitioning 
* Applications to test case(s) in natural and / or managed ecosystems.

**Prerequisites:**

- Required: R (existing workflow and prototype is in R)
- Helpful: familiarity with sensitivity analyses

Flexible to work as either a Small (175hr) or Large (350 hr)

**Difficulty:**

#### [Database Improvements](#db)

**Chris TODO**
- decouple traits from provenance
- make betydb.org data available through R package

#### [Development of Notebook-based PEcAn Workflows](#notebook)

The PEcAn workflow is currently run using either a web based user interface, an API, or custom R scripts. The web based user interface is easiest to use, but has limited functionality whereas the custom R scripts and API are more flexible, but require more experience.

This project will focus on building Quarto workflows aimed at providing an interface to PEcAn that is both welcoming to new users and flexible enough to be a starting point for more advanced users. It will build on existing [Pull Request 1733](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/pull/1733).

**Expected outcome:**

- Two or more template workflows for running the PEcAn workflow. Written vignette and video tutorial introducing their use.

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with R. Familiarity with R studio and Quarto or Rmarkdown is a plus.

#### [Optimize PEcAn for freestanding use of single packages [R package development]](#freestanding)

PEcAn was designed as a system of independent modules, each implemented as its own R package that was intended to be usable either standalone or as part of the full PEcAn system. Subsequent development focused on the most common cross-module workflows has lead to tighter coupling between modules than was originally intended, so that in practice many of the modules are now challenging to use, test, or develop without a full understanding of their interdependencies. Further, some packages expect inputs and outputs in data structures that are only generated by other PEcAn packages but might be more easily provided in standard well-known formats. We seek proposals to re-loosen these couplings by revisiting the design and interface of PEcAn packages through one or more of:

1. Refactoring code to remove unneeded dependencies, simplify package interfaces, and exchange data in standard formats
2. Identifying exported functions that are not core to the functionality of the package, and removing them or making them internal
3. Writing tests and examples that demonstrate freestanding use of the package
4. Developing methods for tracking the dependencies between packages that cannot be eliminated, including how these change between package versions
   Proposals for this project should choose a subset of these approaches and apply them to a specified subset of the PEcAn packages. Strong proposals will clearly show why each chosen package should be a priority, how it will become more independent at the completion of the project, and what interface changes will be needed to achieve this.

**Expected outcome:**

- One or more PEcAn packages can be installed, used, and/or tested without the user needing to know [something previously important] about [another package].

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with R, especially how it manages dependencies between packages, and with concepts of software package development. Helpful resources: [rOpenSci packages](https://devguide.ropensci.org/index.html) and [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org). Experience with multi-package code bases will be very helpful.

#### [PEcAn model coupling and development [Data Science]](#coupling)

PEcAn has the capability to interface multiple ecological models. The goal of this project is to improve the coupling of existing models to PEcAn (specifically FATES) and add new models (specifically a simple vegetation model that is under development). It is also possible to contribute to the development of the simple vegetation model which is written in Fortran.

**Expected outcome:**

- New or improved PEcAn model packages.

**Prerequisites:**

- R, Fortran is an advantage.
