### 1. Refactor and Parallelize Input Processing Pipelines{#input}

Input-processing code in PEcAn (e.g., meteorological preparation) is currently centered around monolithic orchestration functions such as `do.conversions` and `met.process`. These functions mix low-level data transformations with sequential control flow, implicit dependencies, and caching behavior, making them difficult to test, debug, scale, or parallelize across sites and ensemble members.

This project will deprecate `do.conversions` as currently implemented and replace it with input preprocessing workflows that are explicitly structured around data dependencies and are naturally parallelizable across data streams, sites, and ensemble members. The work will refactor or deprecate `met.process` to remove monolithic orchestration and reduce or eliminate opaque caching, while retaining and strengthening existing low-level transformation functions.

As part of the refactor, orchestration logic should be rebuilt to make inputs, outputs, and dependencies explicit. A workflow tool such as {targets} may be used to help define and validate the dependency graph and caching behavior, but must not become a required or exclusive execution path for PEcAn.

This refactoring should also reduce or eliminate implicit dependencies on the global settings object (see Project 3), enabling clearer APIs and improved testability.

**Expected outcomes:**

A successful project would complete the following tasks:

* Deprecation plan for do.conversions, with a replacement that provides a modular suite of preprocessing tools that
   * explicitly defines inputs and outputs, and 
   * supports parallel execution across products, sites, and ensemble members. 
Key here is a high-level plan for development that will continue beyond what is accomplished this summer.

* Refactor and/or deprecation plan for met.process that:
   * removes monolithic orchestration and hidden control flow,
   * reduces or eliminates over-engineered caching,
   * retains and documents low-level transformation functions.

* Demonstration of parallel execution on a multi-site or multi-ensemble example.

* Basic correctness and performance benchmarks, including unit and integration tests and validation of PEcAn-standard inputs (formats and units).

* Updated developer documentation covering:
   * the new input-processing architecture,
   * how to add a new preprocessing step,
   * migration guidance from legacy entry points.


**Prerequisites:**

- Required: R (existing workflow and prototype is in R)
- Helpful: familiarity with parallel computing, workflow refactoring

### 2. Benchmarking and Validation Framework{#validation}

A key task in any modeling workflow is the validation of model outputs against held out observations. When a validation dataset is used repeatedly and agreed upon by a broad community to have particular value in assessing model performance it often gets elevated to the status of a persistent "benchmark" dataset. In PEcAn, there is a need to replace our earlier benchmarking module, whose design was never fully implemented, with a simpler framework. In designing this framework we'd encourage participants to build upon the existing low-level infrastructure in the existing benchmarking module for model-data alignment tools and comparison metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. Work should also build upon and generalize existing examples of "one off" validation scripts (e.g., CARB cropland validations, North American data assimilation validations). 

**Expected outcomes:**

A successful project would complete the following tasks:

* A high-level design and plan for development that will continue beyond what is accomplished this summer
* Unit and integration tests
* A generalized example of a validation workflow and/or notebook using California cropland datasets spanning multiple sites and crop types.
* Documentation


**Prerequisites:**

- Required: R (existing workflow and prototype is in R), familiarity with statistical methods for model validation
- Helpful: Familiarity with existing benchmarking workflow systems

### 3. Increase PEcAn modularity{#module}

Existing PEcAn workflows rely heavily on reading a large `settings` object and writing .RData files or other opaque artifacts to disk to pass state between steps. This behavior reduces transparency, testability, and user understanding. The high-level goal of this project is to make PEcAn’s core functionality more modular and transparent, so that users can more easily build, maintain, and expand PEcAn workflows.

This project refactors a single, well-defined workflow so that functions return explicit R objects (e.g., data frames or lists) instead of relying on hidden on-disk side effects. 

To minimize disruption with existing workflows, the preferred approach would be: 
* To begin by documenting existing functionality
* Where needed, write tests for existing functionality
* Document new functionality
* Write tests for new functionality (TDD)
* Refactoring of functions to return objects
* Then refactor downstream functions use those objects
* Only after that’s working, stop writing out the files.
* If time permits, analyze how PEcAn's high-level modules are using the `settings` object and, where possible, refactor function inputs to only pass the required subset of variables or variable lists.
* Along the way, it would also be beneficial to reassess which functions need to be exported, with the idea that fewer exported functions would make it easier for new users to see what PEcAn’s core modules actually are, and better documenting the core functions and modules we expect users to need to learn/use

**Expected outcomes**:

* Refactored functions that return explicit R objects instead of writing .RData
* Clear definition and doucmentation of object structures passed between steps
* Backward-compatible wrappers where needed to avoid breaking existing workflows
* Unit tests that no longer depend on on-disk state or output_dir
* Documentation describing .RData deprecation, migration guidance, and examples


**Skills Required**:

- Required: R (existing workflow and prototype is in R) and R package development
- Helpful: familiarity with code refactoring

**Duration:**

Suitable for a Medium (175hr) or Large (350 hr) project.

### 4. Development of Notebook-based PEcAn Workflows{#notebook}

The PEcAn workflow is currently run using either a web based user interface, an API, or custom R scripts. The web based user interface is easiest to use, but has limited functionality whereas the custom R scripts and API are more flexible, but require more experience.

This project will focus on building Quarto notebooks that provide an interface to PEcAn that is both welcoming to new users and flexible enough to be a starting point for more advanced users. It will build on existing [Pull Request 1733](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/pull/1733).

**Expected outcomes:**

- Two or more template workflows for running the PEcAn workflow. 
- Written vignette and video tutorial introducing their use.

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with R. 
- Familiarity with R studio and Quarto or Rmarkdown is a plus.

#### BETYdb R data package

BETYdb's web front end is built on a version of Ruby on Rails that is functional byt no longer supported. A key feature of BETYdb is that the data is open and accessible. 

Building an R data package would make the Trait and Yield data currently in BETYdb more accessible to users beyond the PEcAn community.

**Expected outcomes:**

A successful project would complete a subset of the following tasks:

- An R package containing the data currently hosted in BETYdb.
- Documentation and examples of use.
- Updates to BETYdb documentation.

**Prerequisites:**

- Required: R
- Helpful: R package development; familiarity with relational databases and SQL.

**Contact person:**

David LeBauer (@dlebauer)

**Duration:**

Medium (175hr) to Large (350hr) depending on scope of proposal.

**Difficulty:**

Medium

#### [Optimize PEcAn for freestanding use of single packages [R package development]](#freestanding)

PEcAn was designed as a system of independent modules, each implemented as its own R package that was intended to be usable either standalone or as part of the full PEcAn system. Subsequent development focused on the most common cross-module workflows has lead to tighter coupling between modules than was originally intended, so that in practice many of the modules are now challenging to use, test, or develop without a full understanding of their interdependencies. Further, some packages expect inputs and outputs in data structures that are only generated by other PEcAn packages but might be more easily provided in standard well-known formats. We seek proposals to re-loosen these couplings by revisiting the design and interface of PEcAn packages through one or more of:

1. Refactoring code to remove unneeded dependencies, simplify package interfaces, and exchange data in standard formats
2. Identifying exported functions that are not core to the functionality of the package, and removing them or making them internal
3. Writing tests and examples that demonstrate freestanding use of the package
4. Developing methods for tracking the dependencies between packages that cannot be eliminated, including how these change between package versions
   Proposals for this project should choose a subset of these approaches and apply them to a specified subset of the PEcAn packages. Strong proposals will clearly show why each chosen package should be a priority, how it will become more independent at the completion of the project, and what interface changes will be needed to achieve this.

**Expected outcome:**

- One or more PEcAn packages can be installed, used, and/or tested without the user needing to know [something previously important] about [another package].

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with R, especially how it manages dependencies between packages, and with concepts of software package development. Helpful resources: [rOpenSci packages](https://devguide.ropensci.org/index.html) and [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org). Experience with multi-package code bases will be very helpful.

#### [PEcAn model coupling and development [Data Science]](#coupling)

PEcAn has the capability to interface multiple ecological models. The goal of this project is to improve the coupling of existing models to PEcAn (specifically FATES) and add new models (specifically a simple vegetation model that is under development). It is also possible to contribute to the development of the simple vegetation model which is written in Fortran.

**Expected outcome:**

- New or improved PEcAn model packages.

**Prerequisites:**

- R, Fortran is an advantage.
